1.05 Mon Apr 19 10:10:18 2004
	- Got rid of POE::Component::Server::TCP and replaced it with POE::Wheel::SocketFactory for speed/efficiency
	- As the documentation for POE::Filter::HTTPD says, updated POD to reflect the HTTP::Request/Response issue
	- Got rid of SimpleHTTP::Request, due to moving of the Connection object to Response
		->	Found a circular leak by having SimpleHTTP::Connection in SimpleHTTP::Request, to get rid of it, moved it to Response
		->	Realized that sometimes HTTP::Request will be undef, so how would you get the Connection object?
	- Internal tweaking to save some memory
	- Added the MAX_RETRIES subroutine
	- More extensive DEBUG statements
	- POD updates
	- Paul Visscher tracked down the HTTP::Request object leak, thanks!
	- Cleaned up the Makefile.PL
	- Benchmarked and found a significant speed difference between post()ing and call()ing the DONE event
		->	The call() method is ~8% faster
		->	However, the chance of connecting sockets timing out is greater...
